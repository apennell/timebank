# Timebank application


Epoch is a time banking system that allows users to receive services using the currency of their time, which is earned by providing other users with their own services. Every hour of work for someone else is added to their time bank, which can be spent getting help from another user. 
Users sign up for the Epoch web app and act as both a provider and recipient. They list services they can provide as well as services they need. Users can offer to render a service wanted or request that a specific user help them. When a request is made, a text message alert is sent to the the user receiving the request. An exchange page is generated when a request is made and, once accepted, they receive each other's contact information. After service is rendered, this is confirmed on the site and the hour is transferred from the recipient to the provider's time bank. A text message alert is sent to the user at each of the 4 stages of the exchange process--when it is proposed, accepted, delivered, and confirmed.
